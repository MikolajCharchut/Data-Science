    "In the assignment I'm going to explore the similarity between movie plots based on plot descriptions from wikipedia. Especially in this dataset there are two movies that I really like: Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. I wonder if the fact that in both parts there are same heroes in same universum and the plot is continuous through both parts, is the distance between this two movies will always be the shortest among other movies in this dataset."

    "Through this analysis I made many actions to find nearest neighbors to plot of Guardians of the Galaxy movie, that is most similar movies. During this steps all of them seemed resonable, in my opinion the best result I got was from first simple euclidean search of closest neigbors. Maybe it's because I know that movies from result or maybe searching that way for similar stories isn't good idea. I personally lean towards the second option. To prove my point, in top 10 euclidean nearest neighbors is movie titled \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" which action takes place in same universum as Guardians of the Galaxy. But one thing went just as I expected: in all cases Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was the nearest neighbor and that answers my question from introduction, if two parts of the movie will always be the closest to each other, and the answer is yes!"
