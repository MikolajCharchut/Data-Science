# Clustering
Here are my two exercises with data clustering. I used here word count vectors, TF-IDF and different metrics to resolve problem of nearest neighbors. Wikipedia is a task from classes where we had straight tasks to do. The objective here was to find articles that are similar to Obama's wikipedia page. Movies is my own analysis on dataset I chose based on first task. In that one I took wikipedia dataset with movie plot descriptions and tried to find similar movies.
